NOTES

---

- you still lose scores from being bombed I think, both players can be negative which is kinda funny

- if you win a lot, you get such a short fuse that you’re immediately disabled. this seems actually kinda cool though, like an even stronger handicap
- after several rounds, both players have too short a fuse and it’s just a boring delay before game start
  -- fuse budget distributed based on score?

STATUS: implemented simple balancing (winner of round gets shorter fuse, w/ minimum fuse length, loser gets a longer one, w/ maximum)
	could revisit if we want to try the "scored-based" approach

- if players are right next to each other at the start, both are disabled by one having too short a fuse
STATUS: maybe already solved by our fuse balancing?

- bomb and bullets need sprites

- player sprites face wrong way/don't have a clear "forward" direction

- tank controls? for keyboard

- initial fuse direction seems weird, how should it start? zigzag? opposing lines?

- some kind of short “get ready” state before level starts
